# Blue Rose Character Creator

A web application to streamline character creation for the Blue Rose tabletop role playing game. This is a toy app built
partly as a way to learn React and modern web app development tools.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and I don't necessarily
understand everything in it.

## Getting Started

For local development you should:

1. Ensure you have yarn installed.
   1. If you're not sure whether or not you do, you can check by running  `which yarn` or `yarn --version`
   1. If you don't have yarn installed, you can follow [this handy guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).
1. Clone this repository into a new directory by running `git clone git@github.com:sfarqu/blue-rose-character-creator.git`
1. `cd` into the repository directory you've just created
1. Run `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies

You should now be able to run any of the other yarn commands below and begin testing or making changes to this project.

## Available Scripts

This is the Create React App boilerplate, as a reminder of how to work on this project.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
